# Advent2019

My ruby solutions to advent of code 2019 (adventofcode.com).
+ `lib` contains solution files like `day04.rb`, which inherit from `solver.rb`.
+ `data` is a required folder with files like `day04.txt`, but is not included here.

## Usage

+ Run `ruby scripts/setup_day.rb 04 3` to create files for day 4 with 3 test examples.
+ Run `ruby scripts/solve_day.rb 04` to print solutions for day 4.

## Development
Run `rake test` to run the tests.
